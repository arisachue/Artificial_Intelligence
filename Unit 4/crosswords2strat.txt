find most constraint word and start from there

mr eckel's crowwords 2 strategy 
-finding the most constrained
-back track when possible
-keep track of word spaces
-set of all words that can go in each space (keep track of all possibilities)
-copy all data structures to send to recursive call
-place letter, update the sets
-loop over the blank spaces in that word and remove unpossible letters with added letter
-run possibilities every call
